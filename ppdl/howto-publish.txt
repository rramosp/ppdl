Make sure your repo is commited, tagged with the new version number and pushed.
For instance:
   git add 
   git commit -m message
   git tag 0.1.3 # my new version
   git push
   git push origin 0.1.3

To verify the version with which the code will be published, and FIND OUT
THE NEXT VERSION YOU MUST TAG:

   ppdl/bin/get_scm_version

To package and publish your code into pypi:

   rm -rf dist/*
   python setup.py sdist
   twine upload dist/*

If you have not tagged or commited your repo, the version on the package created
by setup tools might be:

   local changes not committed              0.25.dev0+g73731b3.d20220113
   local changes committed (pushed or not)  0.25.dev1+g3ec6e04

   with "0.24" being the last known tag. note the automatic version increment
   see: https://pythonrepo.com/repo/pypa-setuptools_scm-python-build-tools

   in this case, you would ADD A TAG 0.25, as explained above.

git commands to manage tags:

   create tag locally   git tag 0.1.2
   push tag to repo     git push origin 0.1.2
   delete tag locally   git tag -d 0.1.2
   delete tag in repo   git push --delete origin 0.1.2
