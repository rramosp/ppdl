make sure your repo is commited, tagged with the new version number and pushed.
then do:

   ppdl/bin/get_scm_version

to verify the version with which the code will be published. Then do:

   rm -rf dist/*
   python setup.py sdist
   twine upload dist/*

if you have not tagged or commited your repo, the version on the package created
by setup tools might be:

   local changes not committed              0.1.dev0+g73731b3.d20220113
   local changes committed (pushed or not)  0.1.dev1+g3ec6e04

   with "0.1" being the last known tag

git commands to manage tags:

   create tag locally   git tag 0.1.2
   push tag to repo     git push origin 0.1.2
   delete tag locally   git tag -d 0.1.2
   delete tag in repo   git push --delete origin 0.1.2
