# Bayes theorem Continuous distributions



## This is bayesian thinking!!!!

So Bayes theorem, allows us to convert $P(sun|rain)$ into $P(rain|sun)$. The great discovery of Bayes was that we can relate different observations ($rain$, or $sun$) in a very precise manner. We can relate **different information gains**.

example with estimating the position given measurements

Notebook: Estimate position with noisy sensor.

LAB: Estimate the position with velocity and position estimates (i.e. kalman filter)
